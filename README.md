## Super-Glue Project Proposal

### Overview

Machine learning is poised to make an enormous impact in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry. The rapidly increasing scale, throughput and accuracy of biological assays provides the perfect substrate for machine learning algorithms to make sense of the complex biological mechanisms that underpin disease in a way that humans are incapable. However, the intuition built from decades of drug discovery experience by expert medicinal chemists is a vital source of knowledge that is missing from the models built from these assays. Incorporating expert rules into our modeling strategies not only helps improve the performance of our models, but it is also crucial for building trust across domains and integrating ML into current drug discovery pipelines.
 
The goal of this project is to create an interactive tool that will help facilitate this collaboration by providing a flexible framework for ML and MedChem teams to share knowledge through chemical annotations, computations, and predictions in a scalable and data-driven manner.
