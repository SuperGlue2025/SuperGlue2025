### Visualize molecules
input(s): molecule name or chemical formula

output(s): list of skeletal structures of input/similar structures
### Interactive molecular modeling
input(s): Using Ketcher can create 2-d molecular structures (or add to existing ones)

output(s): molecular structure that can be saved and annotated
### Highlight molecules
input(s): drag cursor over section(s) of molecular structure

output(s): section is highlighted in yellow (color selection?)
### Text-based annotation
input(s): click on highlighted section and write notes in a text box/text window

output(s): annotations that can be saved/edited/exported later on
### Save work
input(s): automatic save or a save button?

output(s): work is saved on the site and can be accessed at a later time
### Preprocess data
input(s): Upload file containing user’s tabulated data on their molecules

output(s): Data is organized using machine learning algorithms to allow for convenient analysis
### Similarity search
input(s): molecule name, chemical formula, created molecular structure

output(s): list of molecules with similar structures and/or properties
### Obtain molecular properties
input(s): molecule name, chemical formula, created molecular structure

output(s): list of physical, chemical properties 
### Compatible with prebuilt workflows
input(s): molecular dataset, workflow integration settings

### Import/export/save files
input(s): click a button of said option

output(s): computer filing system window pops up and you can select files to import or export/save your current work
### Automated data clearing
input(s): Raw molecular datasets

output(s): Duplicates removed, missing values handles, data structured for analysis
### Feature engineering
input(s): Molecular datasets, user selected features

output(s): Engineered features for machine learning models
### Submit annotations as structured graph data to backend that is automatically written to disk
input(s): User annotations, molecular structure relationships

output(s): Graph-based annotation storage, backend integration for structured analysis
### Page through lists of molecular structures
input(s): Scroll or drag controls

output(s): Display of molecular structures with navigation through pages

### User register/login
input(s): user signs up with an email address and chooses a password

output(s): user is entered into system and can login and continue previous work
### Flag deviations between molecule and inputted specifications
input(s): molecule, specifications

output(s): molecular properties are combed through and those that aren’t within the threshold of the specifications are flagged (maybe listed or highlighted in the data table)
